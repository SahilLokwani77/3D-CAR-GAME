A simple and realistic physics-based Car Controller made in Unity using `Rigidbody`. This script handles acceleration, braking, turning, and grounded checks using raycasting, making it a great foundation for racing or driving games.

## ðŸ›  Features

- Rigidbody-based movement
- Acceleration & reverse
- Realistic gravity when airborne
- Turning limited to when grounded
- Ground detection via raycast
- Speed cap
- Adjustable parameters for tuning
